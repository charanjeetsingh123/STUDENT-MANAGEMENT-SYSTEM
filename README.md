# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
ðŸ“š Student Management System (C Language)
A simple console-based Student Management System written in C that stores, updates, deletes, searches, and displays student information.
The system uses a text file (students.txt) for persistent data storage.

Only users with the correct password can use the system.

Add Student
Add a new student with details such as:

Contact Number

Grade

Delete Student
Remove a student by their ID.

Display Students
Show all stored student records.

Search Student
Find a student by ID.

Update Student

Persistent Storage
Data is stored in a students.txt file and is reloaded at program start.

âš  Notes
Ensure students.txt is in the same folder as the executable.

Maximum number of students is set to 100 (MAX constant in code).

Contact number is stored as an integer, so leading zeros will be removed.

All file writes overwrite the previous version when deleting or updating records.
